# PHP Cloud Storage SaaS

## About the Project
This project is a **cloud storage SaaS system** developed in PHP. Users can upload, manage their files, and utilize storage space based on their membership level. Files are **compressed in ZIP format**, and the **compression ratio increases based on file access duration**.

ðŸš€ **Note:** This is a **hobby project** and is not a fully comprehensive solution. The file compression methods used are **basic and not fully optimized** for efficiency. The implementation provides a **fundamental approach to compression**, and better techniques could be explored in the future.

- **Membership Plans and Storage Limits**
- **File Upload and Management:**
  - Upload, delete, rename files
